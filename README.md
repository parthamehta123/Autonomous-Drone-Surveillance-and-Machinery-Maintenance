# Autonomous-Drone-Surveillance-and-Machinery-Maintenance

Designed a custom hardware optimized deep learning inference model (YOLO based) for an autonomous quadcopter drone which helps with real-time surveillance. The drone also has bidirectional communication capability and an early warning detection system.

Detailed description of the project is given in the report [Report](https://github.com/sand47/Autonomous-Drone-Surveillance-and-Machinery-Maintenance/blob/master/project_report.pdf)

# Object Detection 

**Note:** This is not the optimized Yolov3 code used in project but instead a generic code. Its not published due to IP concerns.  <br><br>
Download the yolov3 weights from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ and place it inside the folder yolo-deep_learning
<br><br>
Upload images to be tested in yolo-deep_learning/output_aerial folder and run 
<br><br>
python yolo_drone.py 
<br><br>
Ouput images are stored in output folder
